                   cognition is computation on amodal symbols in a
                   modular system, independent of the brain's modal
                   systems for perception, action, and introspection.
                   Instead, grounded cognition proposes that modal
                   simulations, bodily states, and situated action
                   underlie cognition. Accumulating behavioral and
                   neural evidence supporting this view is reviewed from
                   research on perception, memory, knowledge, language,
                   thought, social cognition, and development. Theories
                   of grounded cognition are also reviewed, as are
                   origins of the area and common misperceptions of it.

                   dishes will topple, a branch will support a child's
                   weight, a grocery bag is poorly packed and liable to
                   tear or crush its contents, or a tool is firmly
                   attached to a table or free to be lifted. Such rapid
                   physical inferences are central to how people

                   their computational underpinnings are poorly

                   ``intuitive physics engine,'' a cognitive mechanism
                   similar to computer engines that simulate rich
                   physics in video games and graphics, but that uses
                   approximate, probabilistic simulations to make robust
                   and fast inferences in complex natural scenes where
                   crucial information is unobserved. This single model
                   fits data from five distinct psychophysical tasks,
                   captures several illusions and biases, and explains
                   core aspects of human mental models and common-sense
                   reasoning that are instrumental to how humans
                   understand their everyday world.},

  abstract =      {This paper addresses an important issue in learning
                   from demonstrations that are provided by
                   ``na{\"\i}ve'' human teachers---people who do not
                   have expertise in the machine learning algorithms
                   used by the robot. We therefore entertain the
                   possibility that, whereas the average human user may
                   provide sensible demonstrations from a human's
                   perspective, these same demonstrations may be
                   insufficient, incomplete, ambiguous, or otherwise
                   ``flawed'' from the perspective of the training set
                   needed by the learning algorithm to generalize
                   properly. To address this issue, we present a system
                   where the robot is modeled as a socially engaged and
                   socially cognitive learner. We illustrate the merits
                   of this approach through an example where the robot
                   is able to correctly learn from ``flawed''
                   demonstrations by taking the visual perspective of
                   the human instructor to clarify potential
                   ambiguities.},

  abstract =      {Human-robot interaction often occurs in the form of
                   instructions given from a human to a robot. For a
                   robot to successfully follow instructions, a common
                   representation of the world and objects in it should
                   be shared between humans and the robot so that the
                   instructions can be grounded. Achieving this
                   representation can be done via learning, where both
                   the world representation and the language grounding
                   are learned simultaneously. However, in robotics this
                   can be a difficult task due to the cost and scarcity
                   of data. In this paper, we tackle the problem by
                   separately learning the world representation of the
                   robot and the language grounding. While this approach
                   can address the challenges in getting sufficient
                   data, it may give rise to inconsistencies between
                   both learned components. Therefore, we further
                   propose Bayesian learning to resolve such
                   inconsistencies between the natural language
                   grounding and a robot{'}s world representation by
                   exploiting spatio-relational information that is
                   implicitly present in instructions given by a human.
                   Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of our
                   approach on a scenario involving a robotic arm in the
                   physical world.},

                   embodied cognitive agents, such as humanoid robots,
                   can advance our understanding of the cognitive
                   development of complex sensorimotor, linguistic, and
                   social learning skills. This in turn will benefit the
                   design of cognitive robots capable of learning to
                   handle and manipulate objects and tools autonomously,
                   to cooperate and communicate with other robots and
                   humans, and to adapt their abilities to changing
                   internal, environmental, and social conditions. Four
                   key areas of research challenges are discussed,
                   specifically for the issues related to the
                   understanding of: 1) how agents learn and represent
                   compositional actions; 2) how agents learn and
                   represent compositional lexica; 3) the dynamics of
                   social interaction and learning; and 4) how
                   compositional action and language representations are
                   integrated to bootstrap the cognitive system. The
                   review of specific issues and progress in these areas
                   is then translated into a practical roadmap based on
                   a series of milestones. These milestones provide a
                   possible set of cognitive robotics goals and test
                   scenarios, thus acting as a research roadmap for

                   using Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2016). We

                   transferred learning from pre-trained models and

  abstract =      {Spatial understanding is crucial in many real-world
                   problems, yet little progress has been made towards
                   building representations that capture spatial
                   knowledge. Here, we move one step forward in this
                   direction and learn such representations by
                   leveraging a task consisting in predicting continuous
                   2D spatial arrangements of objects given
                   object-relationship-object instances (e.g., ``cat
                   under chair\") and a simple neural network model that
                   learns the task from annotated images. We show that
                   the model succeeds in this task and that it is
                   furthermore capable of predicting correct spatial
                   arrangements for unseen objects if either CNN
                   features or word embeddings of the objects are
                   provided. The differences between visual and
                   linguistic features are discussed. Next, to evaluate
                   the spatial representations learned in the previous
                   task, we introduce a task and a dataset consisting in
                   a set of crowdsourced human ratings of spatial
                   similarity for object pairs. We find that both CNN
                   features and word embeddings predict well human
                   judgments of similarity and that these vectors can be
                   further specialized in spatial knowledge if we update
                   them when training the model that predicts spatial
                   arrangements of objects. Overall, this paper paves
                   the way towards building distributed spatial
                   representations, contributing to the understanding of
                   spatial expressions in language.},

                   interpret and repair the frame of reference (FoR) in
                   free dialogues discussing spatial scenes. We describe
                   a pilot study in which participants are given
                   different perspectives of the same scene and asked to
                   locate several objects that are only shown on one of
                   their pictures. This task requires participants to
                   coordinate on FoR in order to identify the missing
                   objects. Preliminary results indicate that
                   conversational participants align locally on FoR but
                   do not converge on a global frame of reference.
                   Misunderstandings lead to clarification sequences in
                   which participants shift the FoR. These findings have

  abstract =      {The challenge for computational models of spatial
                   descriptions for situated dialogue systems is the
                   integration of information from different modalities.
                   The semantics of spatial descriptions are grounded in
                   at least two sources of information: (i) a geometric
                   representation of space and (ii) the functional
                   interaction of related objects that. We train several
                   neural language models on descriptions of scenes from
                   a dataset of image captions and examine whether the
                   functional or geometric bias of spatial descriptions
                   reported in the literature is reflected in the
                   estimated perplexity of these models. The results of
                   these experiments have implications for the creation
                   of models of spatial lexical semantics for
                   human-robot dialogue systems. Furthermore, they also
                   provide an insight into the kinds of the semantic
                   knowledge captured by neural language models trained
                   on spatial descriptions, which has implications for

  abstract =      {Understanding and generating spatial descriptions
                   requires knowledge about what objects are related,
                   their functional interactions, and where the objects
                   are geometrically located. Different spatial
                   relations have different functional and geometric
                   bias. The wide usage of neural language models in
                   different areas including generation of image
                   description motivates the study of what kind of
                   knowledge is encoded in neural language models about
                   individual spatial relations. With the premise that
                   the functional bias of relations is expressed in
                   their word distributions, we construct multi-word
                   distributional vector representations and show that
                   these representations perform well on intrinsic
                   semantic reasoning tasks, thus confirming our
                   premise. A comparison of our vector representations
                   to human semantic judgments indicates that different
                   bias (functional or geometric) is captured in
                   different data collection tasks which suggests that
                   the contribution of the two meaning modalities is
                   dynamic, related to the context of the task. spatial

  abstract =      {Generating grounded image descriptions requires
                   associating linguistic units with their corresponding
                   visual clues. A common method is to train a decoder
                   language model with attention mechanism over
                   convolutional visual features. Attention weights
                   align the stratified visual features arranged by
                   their location with tokens, most commonly words, in
                   the target description. However, words such as
                   spatial relations (e.g. next to and under) are not

                   with a robotic system, this system should be capable
                   of grounding semantic representations to their
                   real-world representations, learn spatial
                   relationships and communicate using spoken human
                   language. End users need to be able to query the
                   system what objects it already has knowledge of, for
                   more efficient learning. Such systems exist, but
                   require large sample sizes, thus not allowing end
                   users to teach the system more objects when needed.
                   To overcome this problem, we developed a non-mobile
                   system dubbed Kille, that uses a 3D camera, SIFT
                   features and machine learning to allow a tutor to
                   teach the system objects and spatial relations. The
                   system is built upon the ROS (Robot Operating System)
                   framework and uses Opendial software as a dialogue
                   system, for which a ROS support was written as part
                   of this project. We describe the hardware of the
                   system, the software used and developed, and we
                   evaluate its performance. Our results show that Kille
                   performs well on small learning sets, considering the
                   low sample size it uses to learn. In contrast to
                   other approaches, we focus on learning by a tutor
                   presenting objects and not by providing a dataset.
                   Recognition of spatial relations works well, however
                   no definitive conclusions can be drawn. This is
                   largely due to the small number of participants and
                   the subjective nature of spatial relations.},

                   done using hidden Markov models with a continuous

                   easy way of initializing and training new gestures or

                   the camera. First results with a recognition rate of

                   how to navigate in a miniature town. To enable

  abstract =      {Computer Vision has undergone major changes over the
                   recent five years. Here, we investigate if the
                   performance of such architectures generalizes to more
                   complex tasks that require a more holistic approach
                   to scene comprehension. The presented work focuses on
                   learning spatial and multi-modal representations, and
                   the foundations of a Visual Turing Test, where the
                   scene understanding is tested by a series of
                   questions about its content. In our studies, we
                   propose DAQUAR, the first `question answering about
                   real-world images' dataset together with methods,
                   termed a symbolic-based and a neural-based visual
                   question answering architectures, that address the
                   problem. The symbolic-based method relies on a
                   semantic parser, a database of visual facts, and a
                   bayesian formulation that accounts for various
                   interpretations of the visual scene. The neural-based
                   method is an end-to-end architecture composed of a
                   question encoder, image encoder, multimodal
                   embedding, and answer decoder. This architecture has
                   proven to be effective in capturing language-based
                   biases. It also becomes the standard component of
                   other visual question answering architectures. Along
                   with the methods, we also investigate various
                   evaluation metrics that embraces uncertainty in
                   word's meaning, and various interpretations of the
                   scene and the question.},

                   scientists. In the author's framework, the process of
                   vision constructs a set of representations, starting
                   from a description of the input image and culminating
                   with a description of three-dimensional objects in
                   the surrounding environment. A central theme, and one
                   that has had far-reaching influence in both
                   neuroscience and cognitive science, is the notion of
                   different levels of analysis---in the author's
                   framework, the computational level, the algorithmic
                   level, and the hardware implementation level. Now,
                   thirty years later, the main problems that occupied
                   the author remain fundamental open problems in the
                   study of perception. His book provides inspiration
                   for the continuing efforts to integrate knowledge
                   from cognition and computation to understand vision
                   and the brain.},

  abstract =      {Embodied theories are increasingly challenging
                   traditional views of cognition by arguing that
                   conceptual representations that constitute our
                   knowledge are grounded in sensory and motor
                   experiences, and processed at this sensorimotor
                   level, rather than being represented and processed
                   abstractly in an amodal conceptual system. Given the
                   established empirical foundation, and the relatively
                   underspecified theories to date, many researchers are
                   extremely interested in embodied cognition but are
                   clamouring for more mechanistic implementations. What
                   is needed at this stage is a push toward explicit
                   computational models that implement sensory-motor
                   grounding as intrinsic to cognitive processes. In
                   this article, six authors from varying backgrounds
                   and approaches address issues concerning the
                   construction of embodied computational models, and
                   illustrate what they view as the critical current and
                   next steps toward mechanistic theories of embodiment.
                   The first part has the form of a dialogue between two
                   fictional characters: Ernest, the ``experimenter'',
                   and Mary, the ``computational modeller''. The
                   dialogue consists of an interactive sequence of
                   questions, requests for clarification, challenges,
                   and (tentative) answers, and touches the most
                   important aspects of grounded theories that should
                   inform computational modeling and, conversely, the
                   impact that computational modeling could have on
                   embodied theories. The second part of the article
                   discusses the most important open challenges for
                   embodied computational modelling.},

  abstract =      {Recent trends in robotics have seen more general
                   purpose robots being deployed in unstructured
                   environments for prolonged periods of time. Such
                   robots are expected to adapt to different
                   environmental conditions, and ultimately take on a
                   broader range of responsibilities, the specifications
                   of which may change online after the robot has been
                   deployed. We propose that in order for a robot to be
                   generally capable in an online sense when it
                   encounters a range of unknown tasks, it must have the
                   ability to continually learn from a lifetime of
                   experience. Key to this is the ability to generalise
                   from experiences and form representations which
                   facilitate faster learning of new tasks, as well as
                   the transfer of knowledge between different
                   situations. However, experience cannot be managed
                   na¨ıvely: one does not want constantly expanding
                   tables of data, but instead continually refined
                   abstractions of the data -- much like humans seem to
                   abstract and organise knowledge. If this agent is
                   active in the same, or similar, classes of
                   environments for a prolonged period of time, it is
                   provided with the opportunity to build abstract
                   representations in order to simplify the learning of
                   future tasks. The domain is a common structure
                   underlying large families of tasks, and exploiting
                   this affords the agent the potential to not only
                   minimise relearning from scratch, but over time to
                   build better models of the environment. We propose to
                   learn such regularities from the environment, and
                   extract the commonalities between tasks. This thesis
                   aims to address the major question: what are the
                   domain invariances which should be learnt by a long
                   lived agent which encounters a range of different
                   tasks? This question can be decomposed into three
                   dimensions for learning invariances, based on
                   perception, action and interaction. We present novel
                   algorithms for dealing with each of these three
                   factors. Firstly, how does the agent learn to
                   represent the structure of the world? We focus here
                   on learning inter-object relationships from depth
                   information as a concise representation of the
                   structure of the domain. To this end we introduce
                   contact point networks as a topological abstraction
                   of a scene, and present an algorithm based on support
                   vector machine decision boundaries for extracting
                   these from three dimensional point clouds obtained
                   from the agent's experience of a domain. By reducing
                   the specific geometry of an environment into general
                   skeletons based on contact between different objects,
                   we can autonomously learn predicates describing
                   spatial relationships. Secondly, how does the agent
                   learn to acquire general domain knowledge? While the
                   agent attempts new tasks, it requires a mechanism to
                   control exploration, particularly when it has many
                   courses of action available to it. To this end we
                   draw on the fact that many local behaviours are
                   common to different tasks. Identifying these amounts
                   to learning ``common sense'' behavioural invariances
                   across multiple tasks. This principle leads to our
                   concept of action priors, which are defined as
                   Dirichlet distributions over the action set of the
                   agent. These are learnt from previous behaviours, and
                   expressed as the prior probability of selecting each
                   action in a state, and are used to guide the learning
                   of novel tasks as an exploration policy within a
                   reinforcement learning framework. Finally, how can
                   the agent react online with sparse information? There
                   are times when an agent is required to respond fast
                   to some interactive setting, when it may have
                   encountered similar tasks previously. To address this
                   problem, we introduce the notion of types, being a
                   latent class variable describing related problem
                   instances. The agent is required to learn, identify
                   and respond to these different types in online
                   interactive scenarios. We then introduce Bayesian
                   policy reuse as an algorithm that involves
                   maintaining beliefs over the current task instance,
                   updating these from sparse signals, and selecting and
                   instantiating an optimal response from a behaviour
                   library. This thesis therefore makes the following
                   contributions. We provide the first algorithm for
                   autonomously learning spatial relationships between
                   objects from point cloud data. We then provide an
                   algorithm for extracting action priors from a set of
                   policies, and show that considerable gains in speed
                   can be achieved in learning subsequent tasks over
                   learning from scratch, particularly in reducing the
                   initial losses associated with unguided exploration.
                   Additionally, we demonstrate how these action priors
                   allow for safe exploration, feature selection, and a
                   method for analysing and advising other agents'
                   movement through a domain. Finally, we introduce
                   Bayesian policy reuse which allows an agent to
                   quickly draw on a library of policies and instantiate
                   the correct one, enabling rapid online responses to
                   adversarial conditions.},

  abstract =      {A spoken language generation system has been
                   developed that learns to describe objects in
                   computer-generated visual scenes. The system is
                   trained by a show-and-tell' procedure in which visual
                   scenes are paired with natural language descriptions.
                   Learning algorithms acquire probabilistic structures
                   which encode the visual semantics of phrase
                   structure, word classes, and individual words. Using
                   these structures, a planning algorithm integrates
                   syntactic, semantic, and contextual constraints to
                   generate natural and unambiguous descriptions of
                   objects in novel scenes. The system generates
                   syntactically well-formed compound adjective noun
                   phrases, as well as relative spatial clauses. The
                   acquired linguistic structures generalize from
                   training data, enabling the production of novel word
                   sequences which were never observed during training.
                   The output of the generation system is synthesized
                   using word-based concatenative synthesis drawing from
                   the original training speech corpus. In evaluations
                   of semantic comprehension by human judges, the
                   performance of automatically generated spoken
                   descriptions was comparable to human-generated
                   descriptions. This work is motivated by our long-term
                   goal of developing spoken language processing systems
                   which grounds semantics in machine perception and
                   action.},

  abstract =      {We present Habitat, a platform for research in
                   embodied artificial intelligence (AI). Habitat
                   enables training embodied agents (virtual robots) in
                   highly efficient photorealistic 3D simulation.
                   Specifically, Habitat consists of: (i) Habitat-Sim: a
                   flexible, high-performance 3D simulator with
                   configurable agents, sensors, and generic 3D dataset
                   handling. Habitat-Sim is fast -- when rendering a
                   scene from Matterport3D, it achieves several thousand
                   frames per second (fps) running single-threaded, and
                   can reach over 10,000 fps multi-process on a single
                   GPU. (ii) Habitat-API: a modular high-level library
                   for end-to-end development of embodied AI algorithms
                   -- defining tasks (e.g. navigation, instruction
                   following, question answering), configuring,
                   training, and benchmarking embodied agents. These
                   large-scale engineering contributions enable us to
                   answer scientific questions requiring experiments
                   that were till now impracticable or `merely'
                   impractical. Specifically, in the context of
                   point-goal navigation: (1) we revisit the comparison
                   between learning and SLAM approaches from two recent
                   works and find evidence for the opposite conclusion
                   -- that learning outperforms SLAM if scaled to an
                   order of magnitude more experience than previous
                   investigations, and (2) we conduct the first
                   cross-dataset generalization experiments {train,
                   test} × {Matterport3D, Gibson} for multiple sensors
                   {blind, RGB, RGBD, D} and find that only agents with
                   depth (D) sensors generalize across datasets. We hope
                   that our open-source platform and these findings will
                   advance research in embodied AI.},

                   instructs a human on how to draw a route on a map.
                   The human and robot are seated face-to-face with the
                   map placed on the table between them. The user's and
                   the robot's gaze can thus serve several simultaneous
                   functions: as cues to joint attention, turn-taking,
                   level of understanding and task progression. We have
                   compared this face-to-face setting with a setting
                   where the robot employs a random gaze behaviour, as
                   well as a voice-only setting where the robot is
                   hidden behind a paper board. In addition to this, we
                   have also manipulated turn-taking cues such as
                   completeness and filled pauses in the robot's speech.
                   By analysing the participants' subjective rating,
                   task completion, verbal responses, gaze behaviour,
                   and drawing activity, we show that the users indeed
                   benefit from the robot's gaze when talking about
                   landmarks, and that the robot's verbal and gaze
                   behaviour has a strong effect on the users'
                   turn-taking behaviour. We also present an analysis of
                   the users' gaze and lexical and prosodic realisation
                   of feedback after the robot instructions, and show
                   that these cues reveal whether the user has yet
                   executed the previous instruction, as well as the
                   user's level of uncertainty.},

                   engineering more humanlike machine learning systems.

                   inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured
                   representations can address some of the deepest
                   questions about the nature and origins of human

  abstract =      {In this paper, I will describe a system that was
                   developed for the task of Visual Question Answering.
                   The system uses the rich type universe of Type Theory
                   with Records (TTR) to model both the utterances about
                   the image, the image itself and classifications made
                   related to the two. At its most basic, the decision
                   of whether any given predicate can be assigned to an
                   object in the image is delegated to a CNN.
                   Consequently, images can be judged as evidence for
                   propositions. The end result is a model whose
                   application of perceptual classifiers to a given
                   image is guided by the accompanying utterance.},

  abstract =      {Automatically describing an image with a sentence is
                   a long-standing challenge in computer vision and
                   natural language processing. Due to recent progress
                   in object detection, attribute classification, action
                   recognition, etc., there is renewed interest in this
                   area. However, evaluating the quality of descriptions
                   has proven to be challenging. We propose a novel
                   paradigm for evaluating image descriptions that uses
                   human consensus. This paradigm consists of three main
                   parts: a new triplet-based method of collecting human
                   annotations to measure consensus, a new automated
                   metric that captures consensus, and two new datasets:
                   PASCAL-50S and ABSTRACT-50S that contain 50 sentences
                   describing each image. Our simple metric captures
                   human judgment of consensus better than existing
                   metrics across sentences generated by various
                   sources. We also evaluate five state-of-the-art image
                   description approaches using this new protocol and
                   provide a benchmark for future comparisons. A version
                   of CIDEr named CIDEr-D is available as a part of MS
                   COCO evaluation server to enable systematic
                   evaluation and benchmarking.},

  abstract =      {Visual attention mechanisms have been broadly used by
                   image captioning models to attend to related visual
                   information dynamically, allowing fine-grained image
                   understanding and reasoning. However, they are only
                   designed to discover the region-level alignment
                   between visual features and the language feature. The
                   exploration of higher-level visual relationship
                   information between image regions, which is rarely
                   researched in recent works, is beyond their
                   capabilities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
                   visual relationship attention model based on the
                   parallel attention mechanism under the learnt spatial
                   constraints. It can extract relationship information
                   from visual regions and language and then achieve the
                   relationship-level alignment between them. Using
                   combined visual relationship attention and visual
                   region attention to attend to related visual
                   relationships and regions respectively, our image
                   captioning model can achieve state-of-the-art
                   performances on the MSCOCO dataset. Both quantitative
                   analysis and qualitative analysis demonstrate that
                   our novel visual relationship attention model can
                   capture related visual relationship and further
                   improve the caption quality.},
