# 1. Manage the shell environment
printenv | grep ROS

# the result must be something like this:
# ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
# ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/kinetic/share
# ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
# ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=
# ROS_DISTRO=kinetic
# ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/kinetic/etc/ros

# run the following line if the environment is not ready:
#source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

# 2. Create a Workspace
# 'catkin' is a build system based on CMake and extended with Python.
# most famouse IDEs have their own build system to maintain processes 
# related to maintainig packages in a project and run them for test.
# catkin prepare dependencies and the code to be build and run for ros.
# This is how you can create a catkin workspace which you can write python 
# codes for ros:
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src
cd ~/ros_ws/
catkin_make

# now that the folder is ready to be used as a ros workspace, you must source
# this workspace for shell environment:
source devel/setup.bash

# in order to check if this is correct:
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

# the workspace forlder is part of the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
# /home/mehdi/ros_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share

# In order to understand the ROS file system and folders follow the tutorial:
# http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/NavigatingTheFilesystem 

# 3. Create and build a package
# Within the workspace for your projects, you can have several packages. 
# each package is a folder containing the minimum specifications of its 
# CMake build and the required packages.

# Using the command line tool 'catkin_create_pkg' is an easy way to initialize
# a new package:
# catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]
# As an example, we create a package for this tutorial as following:
cd ~/ros_ws/src
catkin_create_pkg this_tutorial std_msgs rospy

# Now you need to rebuild the workspace, and source it again:
cd ~/ros_ws/
catkin_make
. ~/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash

# For more details you can read the documentations and follow more advanced
# tutorials in the wiki.ros.org.

# 4. Running ROS and your programs in ROS
# ROS needs its core program runing in background. The easiest way to run it is as following:
roscore

# roscore starts the master process with one node. We can see list of nodes 
# with the following command:
rosnode list

# HINTS: you can run commands with nohup in background: 
#nohup roscore &
# but in this tutorial, it is easier to open each process in separate terminals

# the next step is to run a python code in ros.
# here we show how to write a python code in the package folder and run it.
# then we will expand this small program to become a node in ROS.
# First, let's run a hello world for ros:
echo '#!/usr/bin/env python
print("hello rosrun!")
' > ~/ros_ws/src/this_tutorial/src/hello.py

# it needs to be executable as well: 
chmod +x ~/ros_ws/src/this_tutorial/src/hello.py

# this is how you can run it:
rosrun this_tutorial hello.py

# HINT: you can kill nodes with ctrl+c 

# next step is to make it persistent.
# in order make it a valid ros node we just need to assign it a name,
# and tell the ros master.
echo '#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy
rospy.init_node("greeter")
rate = rospy.Rate(1) # it means 1hz
while not rospy.is_shutdown():
   print("hello world {0}".format(rospy.get_time()))
   rate.sleep()
' > ~/ros_ws/src/this_tutorial/src/hello.py

# now if you run it again it stays open:
rosrun this_tutorial hello.py

# you can check its info, in another terminal:
rosnode info \greeter

# nodes alone cannot communicate with eachother,
# messages must be communicated under a ros topic.
# you can list all topics in command line:
rostopic list

# we can start a new topic and send signals there:
echo '#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String
rospy.init_node("greeter")
rate = rospy.Rate(1) # it means 1hz
pub = rospy.Publisher("greeting_topic", String, queue_size=1)
while not rospy.is_shutdown():
   pub.publish("hello world {0}".format(rospy.get_time()))
   rate.sleep()
' > ~/ros_ws/src/this_tutorial/src/hello.py

# now, when we run this node there is no sign of input in this terminal.
rosrun this_tutorial hello.py

# in a seperate terminal, we can check if the new topic is active.
rostopic list

# then, if the /greeting_topic is in the list, we can get the detailed
# information about the publisher and its datatype:
rostopic info /greeting_topic

# we can echo the content that are published in the topic:
rostopic echo /greeting_topic

# similar to the echo action for rostopic, we can also write a node
# which process the published content and then publishes a new materrial.
echo '#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String

def callback(string):
   pub.publish("I heared \"{0}\"".format(string.data))

rospy.init_node("feedbacker")
pub = rospy.Publisher("feedback_topic", String, queue_size=1)
sub = rospy.Subscriber("greeting_topic", String, callback)
rospy.spin()
' > ~/ros_ws/src/this_tutorial/src/feedback.py
chmod +x ~/ros_ws/src/this_tutorial/src/feedback.py

# Notice that we don't need infinit loop to keep the node running now. And the frequency of publishing content in feedback_topic depends on the how frequent the subscriber calls the callback function.

# Now, you can run both of them in two terminals:
# Terminal 1:
. ~/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
rosrun this_tutorial hello.py

# Terminal 2:
. ~/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
rosrun this_tutorial feedback.py
